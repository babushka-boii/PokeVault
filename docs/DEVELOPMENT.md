# Local development

PokéVault currently runs as two development processes backed by native PostgreSQL. The commands below target Arch Linux and assume the repository root as the working directory.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 with `venv` support
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL running locally

Install project dependencies only when setting up a new clone:

- `python -m venv backend/.venv`
- `backend/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt`
- `npm install --prefix frontend`

## Environment

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`, then replace both placeholder passwords locally. Keep the development and test database names different. The real `.env` file is ignored by Git and must never be committed.

Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` only when the API does not use its documented local URL. Vite reads this file when its process starts.

## PostgreSQL and migrations

Start the native service:

- `sudo systemctl start postgresql`
- `pg_isready`

Apply the current schema from the backend directory:

- `cd backend`
- `.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head`
- `cd ..`

From the `backend` directory, use `.venv/bin/alembic current` to inspect the applied revision.

## Development servers

Start the API in one terminal:

- `cd backend`
- `.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --reload`

Start the web client in another terminal from the repository root:

- `npm run dev --prefix frontend`

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The Home view requests `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`, which reports the API and PostgreSQL states separately. A healthy response uses HTTP 200. If PostgreSQL becomes unavailable after startup, FastAPI remains available and returns a sanitized HTTP 503 response; the web client shows a retry action.

## Verification

Run the complete offline quality gate after dependencies and the two local databases are configured:

- `bash scripts/check.sh`

The script stops on the first failure. It checks provider fixtures, backend unit and PostgreSQL integration tests, Ruff, frontend tests, lint, type checking, the production build, and whitespace errors. It never installs packages or refreshes provider data from the network.

Useful focused commands:

- `backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests -v`
- `backend/.venv/bin/python -m ruff check backend`
- `npm test --prefix frontend -- --run`
- `npm run lint --prefix frontend`
- `npm run typecheck --prefix frontend`
- `npm run build --prefix frontend`

If the PostgreSQL integration test is skipped, confirm that `POKEVAULT_TEST_DATABASE_URL` exists in `backend/.env` and points to a dedicated test database. If the Home view cannot contact the API, confirm both development processes are running and that `VITE_API_BASE_URL` matches the API origin.
